<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to SmartOnBuild - your one-stop solution for automated end-to-end software creation! SmartOnBuild is an open-source project that harnesses the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT to facilitate seamless interactions between users and AI-powered chatbots, acting as a Business Analyst (BA) and Solution Architect (SA).</p>

<h3 align="center">Project Overview</h3>

<p>The goal of SmartOnBuild is to provide users with an intuitive web application where they can easily describe their desired final product, whether it's a web application, mobile app, data science project, or more. Our intelligent chatbot, ChatGPT, will guide users through the understanding session, ensuring all essential project details are captured.</p>

<h3 align="center">How It Works</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Visit our application and provide a brief description of your project. No GitHub credentials are required; instead, the application creates a new repository on the project's main account for easy access.</li>
  <li><strong>Understanding Session:</strong> Engage with ChatGPT as it acts as a friendly Business Analyst. ChatGPT will comprehend the project scope and desired final product during this interactive session, which lays the foundation for the subsequent solution design.</li>
  <li><strong>Solution Design:</strong> After the understanding session, ChatGPT transforms into a Solution Architect. It initiates a chatbot-to-chatbot conversation, leveraging your input and the understanding session output. The Solution Architect bot generates accurate and relevant questions, ensuring a robust project plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated Code Generation:</strong> With a comprehensive solution design in place, the web application orchestrates the automatic creation of scripts and folder structures for your GitHub repository. The generated code aligns precisely with your project requirements, saving valuable development time.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous Integration and Deployment:</strong> SmartOnBuild adopts a CI/CD approach, enabling automated testing for various application types, such as data science projects and web applications. The pipeline supports a wide range of testing types, ensuring high-quality and reliable software.</li>
</ol>

<h3 align="center">Roadmap for Future Versions</h3>

<p>Version 1 of SmartOnBuild will not include user feedback during the delivery phase. However, our team is committed to continuous improvement. Future versions will introduce feedback loops, allowing the chatbot to update the code based on user input and further enhance its performance.</p>
